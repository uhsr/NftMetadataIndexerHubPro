# NftMetadataIndexerHubPro

## Description

A Rust-based NFT marketplace smart contract leveraging Merkle tree proofs for efficient royalty enforcement and on-chain provenance tracking, compiled to WASM for cross-chain deployment.

## Features

- Indexes NFT metadata using a distributed, fault-tolerant Apache Cassandra cluster for scalability.
- Implements a GraphQL API endpoint optimized for complex filtering and sorting of NFT metadata attributes.
- Utilizes IPFS content addressing with automatic pinning to ensure persistent NFT media availability.
- Supports automatic metadata extraction from various NFT standards including ERC-721, ERC-1155, and others via configurable adapters.
- Deploys a caching layer using Redis to minimize latency for frequently accessed NFT metadata records.
- Integrates with multiple blockchain nodes simultaneously via WebSockets to provide real-time metadata updates.
- Employs a robust error handling system with automated retry mechanisms for handling blockchain node connectivity issues.
- Generates comprehensive audit logs for all indexing operations, including data source, timestamp, and user ID.
